    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository.
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js and enable caching for pnpm.
      # The "cache: pnpm" option caches your pnpm store based on your lockfile.
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "18"
          cache: "pnpm"

      # Step 3: Install pnpm globally.
      # This ensures that the pnpm binary is in the PATH.
      - name: Install pnpm
        run: npm install -g pnpm@9.1.4

      - name: Enable corepack
        run: corepack enable pnpm

      # Step 4: Verify pnpm installation (optional but helpful for debugging).
      - name: Verify pnpm installation
        run: pnpm --version

      # Step 5: Install project dependencies using pnpm.
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: pnpm install

      # Step 6: Run linting and type checking.
      # This step runs the combined "check" script from your package.json.
      - name: Lint and Type Check
        run: pnpm run check

      # Step 7: Build the Next.js project.
      - name: Build Project
        run: pnpm run build
